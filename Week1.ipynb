We will learn on how this is a great advantage (vs a regular Python script, which has the extension `.py`) later on.\n",

The first one is self-explanatory, on the last two, we can work on this kind of texts in the former and with HTML in the latter.

    "- **Plots are convenient**: Adding some 'magic commands' we can play with different plotting interfaces.\n",

    "- **Not everybody uses Jupyter**: It's a well used tool for educational purposes (such are now), but sometimes you just want to run a script (`.py`) and nothing else, we will work with pure scripts later.\n",
    "- **You can't call functions**: For example, here I define a variable or a function, we can't call this function from another file, and this is possible in python scripts.\n",
    "- **We are using a browser/software**: This will consume memory, for the better or the worse, we can edit a python script even with a notepad or even in the same terminal.\n",
