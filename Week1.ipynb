We will learn on how this is a great advantage (vs a regular Python script, which has the extension `.py`) later on.\n",

    "- **Plots are convenient**: Adding some 'magic commands' we can play with different plotting interfaces.\n",

    "- **You can't call functions**: For example, here I define a variable or a function, we can't call this function from another file, and this is possible in python scripts.\n",
    "- **We are using a browser/software**: This will consume memory, for the better or the worse, we can edit a python script even with a notepad or even in the same terminal.\n",
