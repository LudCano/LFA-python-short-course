    "## Libraries that we will use\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week we will start using libraries, depending on what do you want to do it's better to use or another. At the moment we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) is a library used for general things that involve the system itself (your computer), we will use it mostly for opening and searching for files.\n",
    " - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) is a library that offers some advantages while working with files, we will learn some things in parallel in OS.\n",
    " - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) it's going to be our main library from now on, it offers A LOT of advantages when working with tables (or what we will call now, _dataframes_).\n",
    " - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) it's mostly a numerical library, it offers advantages with numerical processing and calculations.\n",
    " \n",
    "I added a link to its main documentation in each bullet. Just to a click on it!"

    "# 1. Paths\n",
    "What's a path? It a route (in spanish _ruta_), it can tell us where a file is located and from there we can try to reach it. Paths are a combination of directories and subdirectories (and at the end the file itself) and they are usually separated by a backslash (\\\\) or forward slash (/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Absolute path: It's where a file is located from the ROOT (or the origin) of the computer, the advantage is that even if we are accessing from a different directory each time, we can get the file path, the disadvantage is that if we change of computer we have to change our absolute path.\n",
    " - Relative path: It's where a file is located from where YOU are right now, for example, if we want to access any of our data we simply go to `data/`, the disadvantange is that if we change of directory from where we are executing our code, we have to change the relative path.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see it this way, the absolute path is the current directory + the relative path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you are on Jupyter lab you can generate the absolute path by doing a right click on a file, and from VSCode you have the option for both."
